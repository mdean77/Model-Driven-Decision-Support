Glucose and insulin management decision support\r\n      2.  Hypertonic saline for intracranial pressure control\r\n      3.  Ventilator management\r\n\r\nOne major goal of this project is to develop a framework in which students can actively develop decision support applications using Drools, but not have to learn the details of an e4 application, EMF, or the Eclipse system itself.  We should be able to provide a framework in which the student develops their domain model, using EMF, and has to write the GUI that is specific to the domain, but nothing else.  Subsequently, the student would concentrate on conducting the knowledge engineering required for their project, and write the rules using Drools resources.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
